## Title

The Battleship game project is a Python program that allows the user to play the classic game of Battleship on a 5x5 board. The program uses a simple algorithm to randomly place a certain number of ships on the board, and then prompts the user to guess the location of the ships. If the user guesses the location of a ship correctly, they win the game. The program also provides feedback to the user after each guess, letting them know if they hit or missed a ship. The project can be extended to include more advanced features, such as multiple difficulty levels, multiple boards, and a graphical user interface.
